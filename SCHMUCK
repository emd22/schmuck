i - declares integer
s - declares string
^ - marker before name
. - go to next line

=======INTEGERS=======

Imagine having the 'N' as a variable name.

example: i^N!8

"i^" is declaring that 'N' is a integer.
'!' is saying that 'N' uses a single
character number as a value

example2: i^R@12

so, here i used variable name 'R'.
when using a '@' symbol, you can have ints
from 10 up to 99.
